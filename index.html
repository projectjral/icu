                    Quezon City Delos Santos
                </h5>

                <p>
                    De Los Santos Medical Center (DLSMC) is a 150-bed, Level 3 private tertiary hospital in Quezon City
                    with over 779 active and visiting multi-specialist physicians. The medical institution is the 7th
                    member hospital of Metro Pacific Health (MPH), under the MVP Group of Companies headed by
                    businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan.<br /><br />
                    The hospital was founded on September 17, 1949 by Dr. Jose V. de los Santos Sr., known as the Father
                    of Philippine Orthopedics. Together with his wife, Doña Pacita V. de los Santos, they established a
                    30-bed clinic along E. Rodriguez Sr. Boulevard specialized in the treatment and rehabilitation of
                    patients with bone abnormalities in support of their daughters who were stricken with
                    polio.<br /><br />
                    On November 17, 1973, the family-owned De Los Santos Clinic expanded into a 150-bed facility known
                    as De Los Santos General Hospital and added specializations including Internal medicine, obstetrics
                    & gynecology, pediatrics, and surgery.<br /><br />
                    By June 3, 2013, the hospital, now called De Los Santos Medical Center, partnered with Metro Pacific
                    Investments Corporation (MPIC) and became the 7th hospital under the MPHHI banner.<br /><br />
                    Under MPH, DLSMC underwent several upgrades including structural renovations to the main hospital,
                    and conversion of the adjacent building to a Medical Arts Building with over 50 doctors’ clinics.
                    Alongside the hospital’s physical expansions, specialty centers were introduced for specific
                    diagnostic and therapeutic services such as the Eye Center, Arthritis Center, Memory Center,
                    Dermatology Center, Women’s Care Center, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Center, Orthopedic
                    Sports Clinic, Wellness Center, and Advanced Laparoscopic Surgery Center.<br /><br />
                    The hospital also performs specialized services in cardiology, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, and
                    minimally invasive surgery. It also became the first private, level 3 hospital in Quezon City to
                    offer the PhilHealth Z Benefit Package for kidney transplantation.<br /><br />
                    In 2018, DLSMC opened its first Catheterization Laboratory Unit offering interventional procedures
                    for cardiology, radiology, neurology, neuroradiology, and nephrology. True to its commitment of
                    providing “Quality but Affordable Healthcare”, DLSMC developed packages that are competitive with
                    other private hospitals, allowing patients accessible and affordable options to various diagnostic
                    and therapeutic procedures.<br /><br />
                    Together with its structural and service expansion, DLSMC also focuses its efforts on two main
                    growth drivers: Clinical Excellence and Great Patient Experience. The institution continually adds
                    to its roster the best and brightest physicians, nurses, ancillary and administrative staff, as well
                    as adheres to the strictest healthcare and safety standards. Patient feedback is very important and
                    through DLSMC’s Patient Experience Department; input is used to further enhance and improve hospital
                    services not only for the patient, but also their families, and the community.<br /><br />
